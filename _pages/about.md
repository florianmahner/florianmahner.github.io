I am a PhD candidate @ the [Max Planck Research Group Vision and Computational Cognition](https://hebartlab.com/) supervised by [Martin Hebart](http://martin-hebart.de) and a guest researcher @ the [Neural Coding Lab](https://neuralcoding.nl/) supervised by [Umut Güçlü](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/guclu-u). Most of my work is on representation learning in humans and machines. I use a combination of computational modeling, machine learning, and insights from cognitive science to identify similaries and differences between human and artificial systems.


I obtained my MSc in Artificial Intelligence @ [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/ai/) and my BSc in Cognitive Science from the [University of Osnabrück](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html). During my Masters I was a visiting student in Computational Neuroscience @ [BCCN Berlin](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/). I wrote my [masters thesis](assets/pdf/thesis-master.pdf) on reconstructing brain activity from large-scale fMRI data using normalizing flows under supervision of [Umut Güçlü](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/guclu-u/).
