I am a PhD Candidate at the [Max Planck Research Group Vision and Computational Cognition](https://hebartlab.com/) supervised by [Martin Hebart](http://martin-hebart.de). I am also a guest researcher at the [Neural Coding Lab](https://neuralcod.ing/) and co-supervised by [Umut Güçlü](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/guclu-u).

## Research Interests

My work primarily focuses on representation learning in humans and machines. I combine computational modeling and machine learning with insights from cognitive science to understand the similarities and differences between human and artificial systems. I mostly work on vision, but also use insights from language and other domains. I am particularly interested in interpretable alignment of representations and how to use insights from cognitive science to improve machine learning models and vice versa.

I have a bunch of projects on the intersection of these fields. If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out.
