I am a PhD candidate at the [Max Planck Research Group Vision and Computational Cognition](https://hebartlab.com/) supervised by [Martin Hebart](http://martin-hebart.de). I am also a guest researcher at the [Neural Coding Lab](https://neuralcoding.nl/) and co-supervised by [Umut Güçlü](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/guclu-u).


## Research Interests

Most of my work is on representation learning in humans and machines. I use a combination of computational modeling, machine learning, and insights from cognitive science to identify similaries and differences between human and artificial systems.
